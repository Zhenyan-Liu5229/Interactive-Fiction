    You woke up. 
    Itâ€™s ten to one in the afternoon. A normal Friday afternoon, plain and dull as ever.
    You were sitting inside a computer lab, alone. Thirty computers were your only companion.
    You were very anxious. You were supposed to have the last workshop for ENG342, but no one appeared. 
    No, there was no one. No Dave or David.

    You were playing The Stanley Parable. 
    Stanley, the charactor under your control, was standing in front of two open doors.
