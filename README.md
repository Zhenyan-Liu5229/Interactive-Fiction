# Interactive Fiction Game Project

## What is it?  
This is an Interactive Fiction game written in Python.

The game content is based on my experience in *ENG342 Digital Literature:Technologies of Storytelling* class and workshops at University of Otago, New Zealand. I wrote an paper version (the txt file) of this game before the final workshop. When I came back to China, I thought it might be interesting to adapt it into a real game. So I did.

I use Python to build this game only because at that time I was learning Python and was eager to try. I learned basic game patterns from [this online tutorial](https://randomgeekery.org/2007/04/19/python-interactive-fiction---01-handling-a-single-round/). 

Finally I would like to express my gratitude to Dr.Dave Ciccoricco for his wonderful teaching in ENG342 paper. He introduced me to the world of digital literature, and inspired me to write this game.
