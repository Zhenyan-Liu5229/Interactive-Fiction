# Interactive-Fiction

This is my self-initiated Interactive Fiction Project. 

This game is based on my experience in ENG342: Technologies of Storytelling paper in University of Otago, New Zealand. I went on exchange there from July to November, 2016.

I am still trying to improve and expand its contents and functions.
